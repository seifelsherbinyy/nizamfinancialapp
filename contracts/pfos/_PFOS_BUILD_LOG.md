# PFOS Build Log

A separate track from `contracts/_CONTRACT_INDEX.md` (the v1 application index, which
stays frozen at exactly five delivered contracts). This log records implementation of
the ingested PFOS contracts (`contracts/pfos/01..04`), authored against them as the
authoritative build input. See `docs/PFOS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for the full plan.

## Stage 1 — Obligations & Safe-to-Spend (server-free) · COMPLETE

The highest-value stage that needs no server: it turns raw balances into a defensible
"what can I actually spend" figure with visible reserves and honest confidence.

| Phase | Deliverable | Source (ingested) | Status |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| S1.1 | Obligation + policy schema (v2, additive migration) | contract 02 §6, §2.2; contract 01 §5.2 | done |
| S1.2 | Obligation protection engine — funding status, horizons, shortfall | contract 03 §3; contract 01 §5.2 | done |
| S1.3 | Safe-to-spend engine — eight-term reserve waterfall + confidence | contract 03 §2.2/§2.4/§2.5; contract 01 §5.5; contract 02 §10 | done |

### What landed

- `src/features/obligations/obligation.types.ts` — the thirteen-field `Obligation`, the
  P0–P3 tier matrix and override policy, `reserveFor` (the safe-to-spend PROTECTION
  floor: P0 full, P1 minimum, P2/P3 nothing unless explicitly over-reserved),
  `isProtectedTier`, `fundingSequence` (most-harmful-first, total + stable order).
- `src/features/safeToSpend/policy.types.ts` — `FinancialPolicy` as versioned data the
  owner edits (buffers, essential-living, uncertainty/staleness rates, expected inflow);
  conservative `DEFAULT_POLICY` that invents no threshold.
- `src/features/obligations/obligations.logic.ts` — pure UTC date helpers (`addDays`,
  `daysBetween`), shared liquidity primitives (`liquidNow`, `inflowOccurrences`,
  `confidentInflowsBy`, `pendingOutflowsBy`), `fundingAmount` (feasibility, distinct
  from `reserveFor`), the four-rung status ladder (`green`/`amber`/`red`/`critical`)
  walked over the funding sequence with a running cumulative, and the six horizons
  (`1d`/`7d`/`until_inflow`/`30d`/`statement`/`90d`) — `statement` and `until_inflow`
  report `available: false` rather than silently aliasing to `30d`.
- `src/features/safeToSpend/safeToSpend.ts` — the eight-term waterfall (liquid + high-
  confidence inflows − pending − protected − essential − buffer − uncertainty − planned
  credit-card commitments), floored at zero with a truthful `deficit` flag, daily
  allowance, staleness-aware confidence in basis-point bands, freshness, primary risk,
  `whatWouldImprove`, and delayed-income / unexpected-expense sensitivity.

### Integration into the existing app

- `SCHEMA_VERSION` 1 → 2; `migrateV1toV2` is purely additive (seeds `obligations: []`
  and `policy: DEFAULT_POLICY`); Drive sync merges obligations by id and the policy as an
  audited singleton; the local cache persists and restores both (no Dexie version bump —
  reuses the `kv` table).

### Verification

- 58 new tests (obligation type helpers, protection engine, safe-to-spend), every value
  hand-computed. Full suite 193/193 across 19 files. Typecheck 0, lint 0.
- Acceptance harness 19/19 (AC04 floor ratcheted 110 → 185). No new denylisted terms,
  money stays integral, Drive scope + ingestion isolation intact.

## Stage 2 — Purchase Decision Cards (server-free) · COMPLETE

The second headline feature ("decide before you spend"). A DETERMINISTIC policy gate
over the Stage-1 outputs — no LLM (contract 03 §1: the model never sources numbers).

| Phase | Deliverable | Source (ingested) | Status |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| S2.1 | Decision card schema (7 states, 11-line order, evidence-package fold) | contract 03 §4.1/§4.3/§4.4 + JSON schema | done |
| S2.2 | Decision policy gate + card builder | contract 03 §4.2/§4.3; §1 (no-LLM-numbers) | done |

### What landed

- src/features/decisions/decision.types.ts — PurchaseRequest (contract §4.1 inputs),
  the seven Recommendation states (§4.3), toEvidenceRecommendation folding cap+condition
  into the JSON schema's approve_with_conditions, and the eleven-field DecisionCard
  (§4.4 order) plus the four-key HorizonImpacts and the Affordability numbers.
- src/features/decisions/decision.logic.ts — decidePurchase simulates the purchase as a
  single uncleared outflow (credit defers it to the next statement date) and re-runs the
  tested Stage-1 engines, so the decision is exactly as trustworthy as safe-to-spend. The
  ladder is ordered most-protective-first: financially_blocked (worsens any P0/P1 status)
  -> approve (covered in hand) -> approve_with_condition (needs expected income) ->
  alternative (cheaper option fits) -> delay (affordable over 90 days) -> approve_with_cap
  (only part fits) -> reject. Every branch compares the price to a computed safe-to-spend
  figure — no invented thresholds.

### Verification

- 13 new tests (one per recommendation state + card conformance + the evidence fold), all
  values hand-computed against a zero-reserve fixture. Full suite 206/206 across 20 files.
  Typecheck 0, lint 0. Harness 19/19 (AC04 floor 185 -> 200).

### Honest scope note

The one-year effect is a directional/reversibility statement, not a computed net-worth
path — full deterministic forecasting is Stage 3. LLM-judgment dimensions of §4.2
(justification quality, ROI, behavioural context) are deferred to the Stage 7 LLM tier.

## Stage 3 — Deterministic forecasting & Decision Outcome Registry (server-free) · COMPLETE

| Phase | Deliverable | Source (ingested) | Status |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| S3.1 | Decision Outcome Registry (append-only, immutable core, prohibition guard) | contract 03 §12 | done |
| S3.2 | Deterministic forecast engine (cash-flow paths + scenarios) | contract 03 §6 | done |

### What landed

- src/features/decisions/decisionRecord.types.ts — the §12 DecisionRecord (question,
  recommendation, alternatives, policy version, data-snapshot id, frozen forecast, confidence,
  user action, override, review dates, append-only outcomes, net-benefit estimate, learning
  proposal); the SIX PROHIBITED self-modification kinds + two allowed kinds as data.
- src/features/decisions/decisionRegistry.ts — recordDecision (freezes the card's forecast +
  confidence), reviewDecision (APPENDS an outcome, computes prediction error = actual −
  expected, and enforces byte-identical immutable core), guardLearningProposal (rejects the
  six prohibited kinds outright, requires approval for hard-policy changes), proposeLearning
  (a prohibited proposal throws — it can never even be recorded), matureDecisions.
- src/features/forecast/forecast.ts — six horizons (§6.1); deterministic cash-balance path
  built from scheduled events (expected income, pending in/out, obligations on due date);
  three scenarios (baseline / downside=income-delay / upside=feared-costs-miss) produced by
  toggling ONLY the uncertain inputs — no invented magnitudes; ending/min balance, shortfall,
  deterministic shortfall-probability, emergency-buffer days, main drivers; reconciles to
  safe-to-spend's liquid-now at H=today. Monte Carlo / probabilistic ranges defer to the server.

### Integration

- SCHEMA_VERSION 2 → 3; migrateV2toV3 additive (seeds decisions: []); Drive sync merges
  decisions by id; local cache persists/restores them (kv table). Full migration/schema
  regression suite still green.

### Verification

- 22 new tests (10 registry incl. immutability + all six prohibitions; 12 forecast, all paths
  hand-computed). Full suite 228/228 across 22 files. Typecheck 0, lint 0. Harness 19/19
  (AC04 floor 200 → 220).

## Stage 4 — Multi-currency & real net worth (server-free, additive) · COMPLETE

Resolves Conflict C-3. Deliberately ADDITIVE — accounts, transactions and the budget engine
are untouched, so a single-currency EGP database produces byte-identical numbers (the
regression bar). Foreign cash is modelled as a liquid asset rather than a foreign account.

| Phase | Deliverable | Source (ingested) | Status |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| S4.1 | Net-worth schema (assets, FX rates, macro) | contract 01 §6; contract 03 §8.3 | done |
| S4.2 | Net-worth engine (views, FX, real value) | contract 01 §6; contract 03 §8.1/8.2/8.4 | done |

### What landed

- src/features/netWorth/netWorth.types.ts — Asset (financial/real, own currency, liquidation
  haircut, valuation source+time), FxRate (integer ratio to EGP with source+time — no float
  drift), MacroContext (reference currency, annual inflation bps). Intangible capital is
  deliberately excluded from book net worth (contract 03 §8.4).
- src/features/netWorth/netWorth.ts — toEgp/fromEgp/convert (through the EGP base, via
  mulRatio); netWorth() returning the nominal / liquid / liquidation views with an
  explainability component breakdown and an unrated-currency list (missing rates are flagged,
  never silently zeroed); realValue() deflating by whole years of inflation via integer ratios;
  realNetWorth().

### Integration

- SCHEMA_VERSION 3 → 4; migrateV3toV4 additive (empty assets/fx, zeroed macro); Drive sync
  merges assets by id, fx by currency, macro as an audited singleton; local cache persists all
  three. Budget / safe-to-spend / forecast numbers unchanged.

### Verification

- 13 new tests incl. the EGP-only regression (nominal reduces to cash − credit − obligations),
  exact FX rounding, liquidation haircuts, reference-currency expression, and unrated-currency
  flagging. Full suite 241/241 across 23 files. Typecheck 0, lint 0. Harness 19/19
  (AC04 floor 220 → 235).

### Honest scope note

Per-transaction multi-currency SPENDING and a live macro/FX API are deferred (higher
regression risk / a server concern). Projected & decision net worth compose from the Stage-2/3
engines. This completes the server-free product.

### The fork (Stage 5) — needs a human decision, no more server-free code

- Stage 5 = D1 (database location) + D2 (server/bot) choice — see docs/PFOS_HUMAN_DELIVERABLES.md.
- Stage 6 (ingestion tier) needs Path B/C + credentials; Stage 7 (LLM tier) needs the
  not-yet-written contract 05 or an approved interim orchestration policy; Stage 8 (behavioural)
  is last. NONE of these start until the fork is chosen.
